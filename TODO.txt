We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- add more javadocs

- correctly implement the explanation modifier and his behaviour for includes and redirects.

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT written in the rfc.

- remove system.outs/e.printstacktrace and add correct logging everywhere.
  Should we use log4j, slf4j (http://www.slf4j.org/).
  [assigned to Norman Maurer]

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server 
  [assigned to Stefano Bagnara]
  
- add author sections

- add a README
  
- make a list of code we inherited from spfjava

- add a few xdocs for the site generation

- complete macroData implementation (ipv6).

- add tests for the DNSService implementation (mocking the xbill Resolver)

- use dnsjava commands instead of InetAddress.methods for localhost and reverse lookups.
  
Change proposals

- make termfile location configurable ( Maybe building one config file for all ? log4j etc...)
