- add more javadocs <- almost complete!

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT written in the rfc.

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server 
  [assigned to Stefano Bagnara]
  
- add author sections

- add a README
  
- make a list of code we inherited from spfjava
