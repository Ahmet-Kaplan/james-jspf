We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- add more javadocs <- almost complete!

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT written in the rfc.

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server 
  [assigned to Stefano Bagnara]
  
- add author sections

- add a README
  
- make a list of code we inherited from spfjava

- add a few xdocs for the site generation

- Fix junit tests for MacroExpand(ipv6). 

- add tests for the DNSService implementation (mocking the xbill Resolver)

- find out how to request dnsjava-2.0.1 to be added to maven2 repository.

- make the libray threadsafe (Terms and SPF should be reentrant)

- try to contact Wayne Schlitt again to have permissions to include test.txt and to share back our changes.
