We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- change the 1999-2006 copyright to 2006 copyright.
- add more javadocs (my part is mostly undocumented)
- correctly implement the explanation modifier and his behaviour for includes and redirects.
- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT being in the rfc.
- remove system.outs/e.printstacktrace
- change the name to jspf
