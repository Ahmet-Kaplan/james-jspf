We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- change the 1999-2006 copyright to 2006 copyright.

- add more javadocs (my part is mostly undocumented)

- correctly implement the explanation modifier and his behaviour for includes and redirects.

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT being in the rfc.

- remove system.outs/e.printstacktrace and add correct logging everywhere.
  Should we use log4j, sl4j

- change the name to jspf (poject name, package name).
  not sure wether the package should be org.apache.jspf or org.apache.james.jspf.
  the top level project is james and the "server" currently use the org.apache.james instead of
  org.apache.james.server but all the james subprojects should use org.apache.james prefix.

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server
