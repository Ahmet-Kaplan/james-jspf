We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- add more javadocs (my part is mostly undocumented)

- correctly implement the explanation modifier and his behaviour for includes and redirects.

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT written in the rfc.

- remove system.outs/e.printstacktrace and add correct logging everywhere.
  Should we use log4j, slf4j (http://www.slf4j.org/).

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server 
  [assigned to Stefano Bagnara]
  
- add author sections

- add a README

- add SPFHeaders for all results
  [assigned to Norman Maurer]
  
- make a list of code we inherited from spfjava
