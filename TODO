We don't have a JIRA instance for jspf so here is a list of issues

- change the 1999-2006 copyright to 2006 copyright.

- add more javadocs (my part is mostly undocumented)

- correctly implement the explanation modifier and his behaviour for includes and redirects.

- add tests for every MUST and MUST NOT being in the rfc.

- remove system.outs/e.printstacktrace and add correct logging everywhere.
  Should we use log4j, sl4j

- change the name to jspf (poject name, package name). Package name should be 
  org.apache.james.jspf

- move the mockdsnservice data to zone files, like we did in james-server

- add author sections

- add license

- add option to set DNS timeout (possible in dnsjava ?)

- add SPFHeaders for all results
