        The jSPF library is pure Java SPF implementation. It was designed to match the current
        SPF-Specs of 2006 (See RFC section). SPF is also knows as Sender Policy Framework.     
        It was designed to detect email spoofing.This is the solution if you ever was tired
        of getting spam from yourself. For more informations see
